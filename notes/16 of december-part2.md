# Incident Response Playbook Phases

## 1 - Preparation 
- Organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk and impact of a security incident
by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans and educating users.
Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response.

## 2 - Detection and Analysis 
- The objective of this phase is to detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.
Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a security breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.

## 3 - Containment 
- The goal of containment is to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident.
During this phase, security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize the damage.
Containment is a high priority for organizations, because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data.

## 4 - Eradication and Recovery
- This phase involves the complete removal of incident artifacts, so the organization can return to normal operations.
During this phase, security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities.

## 5 - Post-Incident Activity
- This phase includes documenting the incident, informing organization leadership, and applying lessons learned to ensure the organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.  
Depending on the severity of the incident, organizations can conduct a full-scale incident analysis
to determine the root cause of the incident and implement multiple updates or improvements to enhance their security posture.

## 6 - Coordination
- Coordination involves recording incidents and sharing information throughout the incident process based on the organization's established standards.
Coordination is important for many reasons.
It ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and it allows for coordinated response and resolution.
