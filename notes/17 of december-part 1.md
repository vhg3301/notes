# Playbooks
## DATA 17/12/2025
# You can use playbook for:
- Open attacks
- Privacy incidents
- Data leaks
- Denial of service attacks 
- Service alerts
- Others

# SIEM tools and playbooks
- The playbooks create the structure, guarantee compliance and describe communication and documentation procedures
Different organizations have different playbooks to deal with attacks like ransomware, malware and denial of service

## Example:
- A playbook is created to guide you to respond to an incident and deal with an attack

### First step - Preparation
The first step is to prepare your team and systems before incidents happen, including training, tools setup, and creating the playbooks

### Second Step - Detection & Analysis
Then, you need to verify if the attack is valid by analyzing logs, alerts from SIEM, and identifying the scope of the incident

### Third step - Containment
Now, you need to isolate the infected system to prevent the malware from spreading to other parts of the network

### Fourth step - Eradication
After containment, you must remove the malware completely from all affected systems and close the vulnerabilities that allowed the attack

### Fifth step - Recovery
Then, you need to restore the data and assets that were infected by the attack, using a clean backup to restore the system to normal operations

### Sixth step - Post-Incident Activity
Finally, you need to create documentation to communicate the incident response to your partners or cybersecurity agencies, and conduct lessons learned meetings to improve future responses

PS: this is a complete example of how a playbook normally works following the NIST incident response framework
