Imagine that you have to define what, why amd how much attention put in a client data.

Analyze: "What if a data leak occurs?"

Decide: "It's more worth a better cryptography or training the employees?"

Plan: "If occurs a attack, how we keep operating?"

## Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation is have the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk, like a breach

## Compliance

Compliance is the primary method used to develop internal security policies, regulatory requirements and the independent standards in an organization

## Business Continuity

The security and risk management can be different in world and organizations. But the goals can be similar in most cases
As a security professional, this means following rules and expectations to mitigate negligence, abuse or fraud

## Asset security

Asset security is focused on securing digital and physical assets.
It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

It's like the life cicle of a data:

## Security Architecture and Engineering

- Security architecture and engineering is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place 
to protect an organization's assets and data.

## Shared responsibilities

example: 2FA authentication	

## Security Operations

## Software Development Security
